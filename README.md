### Overview
This project is a collaborative software development platform
designed for undergraduate CS students, featuring a
console-based arcade of classic and logic-driven games.

It is intended to help students practice software
development principles (such as, agile development,
test-driven development, object-oriented design, pair-programming,
and refactoring) through fun and meaningful work.

The goal is to reinforce core and agile software development
concepts and practices by contributing in an engaging,
real-world context.
